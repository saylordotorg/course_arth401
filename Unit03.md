**Unit 3: Art of the Middle Byzantine Period (843-1204)** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will build on what we learned in Unit 2 and turn to
the Middle Byzantine Period.  The Middle Byzantine Period saw a
resurgence in Byzantine political and artistic power after the end of
iconoclasm.  During this period, churches, manuscripts, and icons were
all produced in large numbers with images that would have been destroyed
in the earlier iconoclastic period.  The unit emphasizes the Byzantine
Empire’s contact with its neighbors, which was on the rise during this
period.  In fact, Byzantine influence extended as far as Kiev and
Lebanon at the time. *  
  
 *Although much of this period was defined by newfound security and
power, Byzantium’s position became unstable by the beginning of the
thirteenth century, and Western Crusaders sacked the city in 1204, a
defining moment in Byzantine art and history.*
