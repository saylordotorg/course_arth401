**Unit 2: Art of the Early Byzantine Period** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will build on what we learned in Unit 1 and turn to
the earliest art of the Byzantine Empire, a Christian “new Rome” in the
East.  This unit begins with Constantine’s founding of Constantinople in
the fourth century and continues through the eighth century.  In this
period, Christian art, while still inextricably linked to the Classical
past, began to develop more of its own unique character.  The building
of churches flourished in Byzantium as well as in Italy.  Meanwhile,
icon painting emerged with the goal of depicting the “un-seeable,”
ethereal qualities of the spiritual world, and religious art took on a
newfound imperial glory.  By this stage, Byzantium had supplanted Rome
and become the new epicenter of the “Western” world.*  
  
 *You may wish to refer to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Glossary for
a list of key Byzantine terms. *
