**Unit 4: Art of the Late Byzantine Period (1204-1453+)** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will turn to the Late Byzantine Period and its
eventual demise.  Like the Middle Byzantine Period, the Late Byzantine
Period was a time of resurgence.  After the sack of Constantinople, the
empire was restored under the rule of the Paleologan Dynasty.  (The
period is therefore often called the “Paleologan Renaissance.”)  The
arts flourished both in Constantinople as well as in its many satellite
regions, and especially in Russia.  The period was also marked by
conflict as tensions between the Western (Catholic) Church and the
Byzantine (Orthodox) Church grew.  The Byzantine Empire was
simultaneously feeling the pressure from the Muslim East.  By 1453, the
empire’s position was so precarious that it could not sustain its
position, and the Ottoman Turks sacked Constantinople, marking the
official end of the empire.  Although the Byzantine Empire ceased to
exist from this date forward, its influence continued to be felt for
centuries.  As the Italian Renaissance was in its infancy, artists
borrowed from Byzantium’s rich tradition.  Further away, in the emerging
Russian Empire, Byzantine art found a new home and a new culture.   *
