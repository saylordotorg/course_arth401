Course Syllabus for "ARTH401: Early Christian and Byzantine Art "
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we will study the history of Eastern (Orthodox)
Christian art.  The course begins with an overview of the emergence of
Christianity in the Late Antique period and the formation of the
Christian visual language that grew out of the Classical tradition.  The
course then follows the development of Christian art after the fall of
the Roman Empire and the emergence of a “new Rome” in the East: the
Byzantine Empire.  A series of reading assignments paired with lectures
and virtual tours will introduce you to important works of Early
Christian and Byzantine art and will also give you an understanding of
the central debates of Early Christian and Byzantine art historical
scholarship. By the time you finish the course, you will be able to
identify the most important artworks from this period and understand how
their appearances relate to the social, political, and religious
environment in which they were produced.  You will also be able to trace
the ways in which Early Christian and Byzantine art changed over time
and identify some of the proposed reasons for these changes.  Further,
you will gain an understanding of the unique position of the Early
Christian and Byzantine worlds and the works of art and architecture
produced in these cultures.  An understanding of Early Christian and
Byzantine Art will round out your art historical education, enhancing
your knowledge of art produced by other cultures and in different
historical periods.
