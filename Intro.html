<p><strong>Unit 1: Early Christian Art</strong> <span id="1"></span> <em>This course begins with the earliest examples of Christian art, which date back to the second century in Rome. The Christian art created during this period emerged directly out of the Classical Roman artistic tradition and is often difficult to distinguish as “Christian.” Not only were stylistic elements borrowed from Roman art but so too were subjects and themes; Roman gods like Apollo took on new significance in a Christian context, for example, and the Roman basilica assumed a new function as a Christian building. While indebted to Roman tradition, as Christian art became more confident and reached a wider and wider audience, it began to declare its Christian message with greater force and originality. </em></p>
