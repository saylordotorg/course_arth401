<h2 id="course-syllabus-for-arth401-early-christian-and-byzantine-art">Course Syllabus for &quot;ARTH401: Early Christian and Byzantine Art &quot;</h2>
<p>In this course, we will study the history of Eastern (Orthodox) Christian art. The course begins with an overview of the emergence of Christianity in the Late Antique period and the formation of the Christian visual language that grew out of the Classical tradition. The course then follows the development of Christian art after the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of a “new Rome” in the East: the Byzantine Empire. A series of reading assignments paired with lectures and virtual tours will introduce you to important works of Early Christian and Byzantine art and will also give you an understanding of the central debates of Early Christian and Byzantine art historical scholarship. By the time you finish the course, you will be able to identify the most important artworks from this period and understand how their appearances relate to the social, political, and religious environment in which they were produced. You will also be able to trace the ways in which Early Christian and Byzantine art changed over time and identify some of the proposed reasons for these changes. Further, you will gain an understanding of the unique position of the Early Christian and Byzantine worlds and the works of art and architecture produced in these cultures. An understanding of Early Christian and Byzantine Art will round out your art historical education, enhancing your knowledge of art produced by other cultures and in different historical periods.</p>
