**Unit 1: Early Christian Art** <span id="1"></span> 
*This course begins with the earliest examples of Christian art, which
date back to the second century in Rome.  The Christian art created
during this period emerged directly out of the Classical Roman artistic
tradition and is often difficult to distinguish as “Christian.”  Not
only were stylistic elements borrowed from Roman art but so too were
subjects and themes; Roman gods like Apollo took on new significance in
a Christian context, for example, and the Roman basilica assumed a new
function as a Christian building.  While indebted to Roman tradition, as
Christian art became more confident and reached a wider and wider
audience, it began to declare its Christian message with greater force
and originality. *
